ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SpaceMerlin33

I'm excited to share with you a little bit about myself. I'm a software developer and UXUI designer. I've been creating software projects since 2008 and have loved every moment of it.

ðŸ’» Currently, I'm proud to be part of the GitLens product team, a powerful Git extension for Visual Studio Code. With GitLens, developers can easily navigate and explore Git repositories, understand code changes with a side-by-side comparison, and gain insights into their codebase's history.

ðŸ“± In addition to my work with GitLens, I also run my own development company, where I focus on building high-quality software products for businesses and individuals. I believe in creating elegant solutions to complex problems and always strive to exceed my clients' expectations.

ðŸŽ§ I also make my own music under the name Merlin. Checkout my SoundCloud: [Merlin](https://soundcloud.com/merlinsbeats)

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about software development, feel free to reach out to me! You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/SpaceMerlin33).
