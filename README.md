ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SpaceMerlin33

I'm a software developer and UXUI designer. 

ðŸ’» Currently, I'm proud to be part of the GitLens product team, a powerful Git extension for Visual Studio Code. With GitLens, developers can easily navigate and explore Git repositories, understand code changes with a side-by-side comparison, and gain insights into their codebase's history.

ðŸ“± In addition to my work with GitLens, I also run my own development company, where I focus on building high-quality software products for businesses and individuals. I believe in creating elegant solutions to complex problems and always strive to exceed my clients' expectations.

ðŸŽ§ I also make my own music under the name Myrlyn. Checkout my SoundCloud: [Myrlyn](https://soundcloud.com/myrlyn1)
