ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SpaceMerlin33

Dev and UXUI designer. Building fun projects since my first web plugin & mobile app in 2013. 

ðŸ’» Currently, proud to be part of the [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) product team, a powerful Git extension for Visual Studio Code. With GitLens, developers can easily navigate and explore Git repositories, understand code changes with a side-by-side comparison, and gain insights into their codebase's history.

ðŸ“± In addition to working with GitLens, I also run my own development company, where I focus on building software products and tools for clients. I believe in creating elegant solutions to complex problems and always strive to exceed clients expectations.

ðŸŽ§ I also make beats. Checkout my SoundCloud: [Myrlyn](https://soundcloud.com/myrlyn1)
